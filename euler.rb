# Euler #1
# Answer: 233168
#
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
# we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
#
# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

    (1..999).select { |n| n % 3 == 0 or n % 5 == 0 }.inject(0) { |a,b| a + b }
end


# Euler #2
# Answer: 4613732
#
# Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
# two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
#
# 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
#
# Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not
# exceed four million.

def euler2
    n, a, b = 2, 1, 2
    while true do
        c = a + b
        if c > 4000000
            break
        end
        if c % 2 == 0
            n = n + c
        end
        a, b = b, c
    end
    n

# Euler #3

# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

# Problem #4
# Answer: 906609
#
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest
# palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 =
# 91 99.
#
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit
# numbers.

# Problem #5
# Answer: 232792560
#
# 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the
# numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
#
# What is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the
# numbers from 1 to 20?

# Problem #6
# Answer: 25164150
#
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#     1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#     (1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
# hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# Problem #7
# Answer: 104743
#
# By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
